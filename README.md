# psxero
a psx emulator made as a passion project

This emulator is being implemented following Simias guide to learn emulation with the PSX console,
The current objective is implement instructions and required data structures that the console throws
until it can boot and show something.

While this code can be useful for someone that doesn't want to be overwhelmed by the gigantic codebases that are ePSX,
Duckstation or current version of Rustation(Simias own emulator and base for the guide), so they can have a basic idea on how emulator are made.
Beyond that, this project still is early and fortunately for the end of the year it will be capable of running beyond the BIOS.
